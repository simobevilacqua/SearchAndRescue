# Search and Rescue

Application developed for the course "Formal Methods for Concurrent and Real-Time Systems" of the Polytechnic of Milan.

## Goal
The main goal of the project is to create a formal model for an automated rescue system.

## Description
The project is an implementation of a formal model for an automated rescue system in case of fire, using the UPPAAL framework.
The rescue is managed by a set of drones that interact with the people in the endangered area to instruct them to save others or to call specialized people to rescue them.  
The system models the drones, the civilians, the first responders (who are helping the people in danger) and a semaphore (to coordinate the communication between models).
